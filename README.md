Simple Firefox OS App template

This is just a demonstration of how powerfull Firefox OS Buidling blocks (http://buildingfirefoxos.com/index.html) can be.

Three simple screens are being generated, and moving from one to another is being made through #hrefs.

This WebApp can be run on a Firefox Desktop Browser. Nightly build is encouraged, as well as using responsive design web developer tool (well, this is always encouraged), to see how it adapts to the "offial" screen resolution (320x480) as well as other resolutions.

Rapid prototyping should not be an excuse anymore!
